# Pointnet implementation
This is a pointnet implementation based on this repository [3D semantic segmentation reporsitory](https://github.com/itberrios/3D) for more details. Which is based on [Pointnet](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet). Our implementation is used in University of Oulu research.
